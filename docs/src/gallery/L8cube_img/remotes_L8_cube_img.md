# Exploring a _cube_ of Landsat 8 data
Here we will show examples of the type of things we can do with Landsat 8 data stored in a _cube_ for better organisation and easyness of access.

The data was downloaded from [EarthExplorer](https://earthexplorer.usgs.gov) and comprises the scene with Product ID ```LC08_L1TP_204033_20210525_20210529_02_T1```.

The _cube_ was made with this instructions (but they would only work if you had the scene files in your computer).

```path = C:/v/LC08_L1TP_204033_20210525_20210529_02_T1/LC08_L1TP_204033_20210525_20210529_02_T1_B;```

```cube = cutcube(bands=[2,3,4,5,6,7,10], template=path, region=(485490,531060,4283280,4330290), save=".\LC08_L1TP_20210525_02_cube.tiff")```

This creates a 3D GeoTIFF file with the companion MTL file saved in it as Metadata. We can see the band info by running the ```reportbands``` function. That information is quite handy because we can, for example, just refer to the _red_ band and it will figure out which layer of the cube contains the Red band.


```julia
using RemoteS, GMT
reportbands("c:/v/LC08_L1TP_20210525_02_cube.tiff")
7-element Vector{String}:
 "Band 2 - Blue [0.45-0.51]"
 "Band 3 - Green [0.53-0.59]"
 "Band 4 - Red [0.64-0.67]"
 "Band 5 - NIR [0.85-0.88]"
 "Band 6 - SWIR 1 [1.57-1.65]"
 "Band 7 - SWIR 2 [2.11-2.29]"
 "Band 10 - Thermal IR 1 [10.6-11.19]"
```

So to start our exploration the best is to generate a true color image. The ```truecolor``` function knows how to do that automatically including the histogram contrast stretch.

```julia
Irgb = truecolor("c:/v/LC08_L1TP_20210525_02_cube.tiff");
imshow(Irgb)
```

```@raw html
<img src="../LC08_L1TP_20210525_02_RGB.png" width="500" class="center"/>
```

And we can compute the brightness temperature in Celsius at the Top of Atmosphere (TOA) from Band 10.

```julia
T = dn2temperature("c:/v/LC08_L1TP_20210525_02_cube.tiff", band=10);
imshow(T, dpi=150, colorbar=true)
```

```@raw html
<img src="../LC08_L1TP_20210525_02_Tbright.png" width="500" class="center"/>
```

Or the Radiance TOA for the Blue band.

```julia
Btoa = dn2radiance("c:/v/LC08_L1TP_20210525_02_cube.tiff", bandname="blue");
imshow(Btoa, dpi=150, color=:gray)
```

```@raw html
<img src="../LC08_L1TP_20210525_02_Gtoa.png" width="500" class="center"/>
```

Hmmm, very dark. Let's look at its histogram.

```julia
histogram(Btoa, auto=true,  show=true)
```

```@raw html
<img src="../LC08_L1TP_20210525_02_Btoa_histo.png" width="350" class="center"/>
```

Yes, the data is very concentraded in the low numbers. We will need to apply a contrast stretch.
To do that operation we will use the ```rescale``` function with the ``stretch=true`` option that
uses the limits displayed in the histogram figure above ans stretches the inner interval into
`[0 255]` (by effect of the ``type=UInt8`` option).

```julia
Btoa_img = rescale(Btoa, stretch=true, type=UInt8);
imshow(Btoa_img)
```

```@raw html
<img src="../LC08_L1TP_20210525_02_Btoa_hist.png" width="500" class="center"/>
```

Now we are going to do the same for all Red, Green and Blue bands and compose the in a truecolor image.
Repeating, we are going to compute the radiance at the top of atmosphere, retain only the data inside the
parts of the histogram where it is more concentrated and create a true color image. To compute the radiance TOA
we can do it all at once with the ```dn2radiance``` applied to the cube and, like before, create the RGB image
with ```truecolor```

```julia
cube_toa_rad = dn2radiance("c:/v/LC08_L1TP_20210525_02_cube.tiff");
Irgb_toa = truecolor(cube_toa_rad);
imshow(Irgb_toa)
```

```@raw html
<img src="../LC08_L1TP_20210525_02_RGB_toa.png" width="500" class="center"/>
```

Hm, yes, very nice but it looks very much like the one obtained directly with the digital numbers.
Indeed, it does but let us zoom in.

```julia
grdimage(Irgb, region=(502380,514200,4311630,4321420), figsize=8, frame=:bare)
grdimage!(Irgb_toa, figsize=8, projection=:linear, xshift=8, frame=:bare, show=true)
```

```@raw html
<img src="../LC08_L1TP_20210525_02_RGB_compare.png" width="600" class="center"/>
```

We can now clearly see that the image on the right, the one made the radiance TOA, has an higher
contrast than the one made with data without any corrections.
